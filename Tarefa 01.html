		<h2> Talking to the Moon </h2>
		<h3> Letra: </h3>
		<p> I know you're somewhere out there</br>
			Somewhere far away</br>
			I want you back, I want you back</br>
			My neighbors think I'm crazy</br>
			But they don't understand</br>
			You're all I had, you're all I had </p>
		<p> At night, when the stars light up my room</br>
			I sit by myself </p>
		<p> Talking to the moon</br>
			Trying to get to you</br>
			In hopes you're on the other side talking to me, too</br>
			Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?</br>
			Oh-oh </p>
		<p> I'm feeling like I'm famous, the talk of the town</br>
			They say I've gone mad</br>
			Yeah, I've gone mad</br>
			But they don't know what I know</br>
			'Cause when the sun goes down, someone's talking back</br>
			Yeah, they're talking back, oh </p>
		<p> At night, when the stars light up my room</br>
			I sit by myself </p>
		<p> Talking to the moon</br>
			Trying to get to you</br>
			In hopes you're on the other side talking to me, too</br>
			Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon? </p>
		<p> Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah</br>
			Do you ever hear me calling?</br>
			(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah) oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh </p>
		<p> 'Cause every night, I'm talking to the moon</br>
			Still trying to get to you</br>
			In hopes you're on the other side talking to me, too</br>
			Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?</br>
			Oh-oh </p>
		<p> I know you're somewhere out there</br>
			Somewhere far away </p>
		
		<h2> When I Was Your Man </h2>
		<h3> Letra: </h3>
		<p> Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now</br>
			Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same</br>
			When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down</br>
			'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name </p>
		<p> It all just sounds like ooh, ooh, ooh, hoo</br>
			Mm, too young, too dumb to realize</br>
			That I should have bought you flowers</br>
			And held your hand</br>
			Should have gave you all my hours</br>
			When I had the chance</br>
			Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance </p>
		<p> Now my baby's dancing</br>
			But she's dancing with another man </p>
		<p> My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways</br>
			Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life</br>
			Now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh</br>
			And that haunts me every time I close my eyes </p>
		<p> It all just sounds like ooh, ooh, ooh, hoo</br>
			Mm, too young, too dumb to realize</br>
			That I should have bought you flowers</br>
			And held your hand</br>
			Should have gave you all my hours</br>
			When I had the chance</br>
			Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance </p>
		<p> Now my baby's dancing</br>
			But she's dancing with another man </p>
		<p> Although it hurts</br>
			I'll be the first to say that I was wrong</br>
			Oh, I know I'm probably much too late</br>
			To try and apologize for my mistakes</br>
			But I just want you to know </p>
		<p> I hope he buys you flowers</br>
			I hope he holds your hand</br>
			Give you all his hours</br>
			When he has the chance</br>
			Take you to every party</br>
			'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance</br>
			Do all the things I should have done</br>
			When I was your man</br>
			Do all the things I should have done</br>
			When I was your man </p>
